This is the source code for B-Notes.

The project is viewable at http://problemapp-env.us-east-1.elasticbeanstalk.com/

B-notes is a database of example problems from a wide range of STEM disciplines. I started this project hoping to improve the design and availability of digital education materials.

When learning a new concept during my undergraduate engineering studies, example problems were critical for grounding theoretical material in the real world. Reading through example problems would help me understand, remember, and recall the material better. I would, however, often struggle to find more than just a few examples for a given concept. Moreover, cluttered and disorganized layouts would often make the few available resources unusable. However, I hope this website will help new learners to access the material better than I did.

I am currently working on writing content and testing the user interface. If you have any feedback or suggestions please contact me at michael_j_lee@alumni.brown.edu.

Planned software developments include...
- Switching to a SQL database
- Cleaning up React Components
- Implementing loading spinners
- Protected API paths for an admin GUI
